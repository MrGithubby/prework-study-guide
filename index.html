          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. </li>
          <li>The == operator checks for equality of values after performing type coercion, which means it tries to convert operands to the same type before making the comparison.</li>
          <li>The === operator checks for strict equality, meaning it compares both the values and the types of the operands without performing type coercion.</li>
